Hello Central Grader!

I'll share with you the following things: screenshots of my results (repo), my code in .txt (repo) and the link of the unsolved excel(link) if you want to run the code in a book while you are grading.

It's worth saying that ive been having help from students of my group and been helping each other noticing errors and giving tips from our codes and ways of making less heavy the code it self for run better.
